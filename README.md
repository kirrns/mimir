**The agent memory that has to earn its keep.**

You've felt this: your coding agent nails a fix, you move on, and three
sessions later it makes the *exact same mistake* again. Every "memory" tool
promises to fix this by hoarding everything it sees — every file, every
message, every guess — and hoping that helps next time. Most of the time it
doesn't. It just makes retrieval slower.

Mimir does the opposite. It watches your agent fail, turns that failure into
one specific, testable lesson — think of it like a skill your agent actually
earns, not a memory dump — and only keeps it if a real before/after benchmark
*proves* the agent performs measurably better with it. No proof, no lesson.
Ever. And every lesson it does keep is HMAC-signed and traceable back to the
failure that created it, so nothing gets into your agent's head without a
paper trail.

Install it once. Capture runs quietly in the background of every Claude Code
session — it never blocks, never raises. From then on your agent gets
sharper the more you use it, and you can always see exactly which lesson
fixed which mistake.

> Status: **v0.0.1 — in active development.** The lifecycle below works
> end-to-end; interfaces will still move.

## How it works

Mimir watches an agent work, distills its failures into lessons, and serves
those lessons back — with a paper trail at every step.

```
capture (fast path)          consolidate (slow path)          recall (MCP)
─────────────────────        ─────────────────────────        ─────────────────

raises.
```

The unit of memory:

- **EPISODE** — raw experience: what the agent did, in what context, with what
  consequence, scored by a deterministic verifier.
- **LESSON** — a distilled, specific directive (never "be careful") with a
  confidence score that moves only on scored evidence, an HMAC-SHA-256
  citation back to its supporting episodes, and a bi-temporal lifecycle
  (`active → quarantined / superseded / retired` — never hard-deleted).

---

## What this looks like day to day

- **You install it once.** The hook logs failures in the background; you
  never think about it again during a normal session.
- **You run `mimir consolidate` when you want the last batch of failures
  turned into lessons** — after a rough session, at the end of the day,
  or on a cron job. It's a deliberate step, not a black box.
- **From then on, recall is automatic.** Every session after that, the
  agent pulls in whatever lessons actually clear the bar for the context
  it's in — you don't ask for it, you just notice fewer repeat mistakes.
- **You can always audit why.** Every lesson traces back to the specific
  failure and the benchmark that proved it helped — `mimir.forget` retires
  one instantly if it ever stops earning its keep.

---

## The benchmark (why "prove" isn't a metaphor)

`bench/` contains a WARM/COLD attribution harness: the same tasks are run by
an agent with Mimir's lessons (WARM) and without (COLD), with seeded runs, a
held-out probe set, and an ε-gate — a lesson is only admitted if the measured
lift clears the noise floor. This is the core bet: memory you can't attribute
to an outcome improvement is just storage.

|  | Typical memory layer | Mimir |
|---|---|---|
| What gets kept | Everything it sees | Only what clears the ε-gate |
| Evidence | "Should help" | WARM vs. COLD, seeded, noise-banded |
| Can you reproduce the claim? | Usually not — take the vendor's word | Yes — `demo_band()` is one command, on your machine |
| Traceability | Opaque blob | HMAC-signed, cited back to the failing episode |

```bash
pytest tests/test_live.py                                    # token-free: injected fake model
python -c "from bench.live import demo_band; demo_band(3)"  # live: real Claude via your CLI, ~27 calls
```

The live run prints each arm's mean success rate with a (min, max) noise band —
a WARM−COLD lift smaller than the band is reported as noise, not a result.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install 'mimir[mcp,cognee]'

# 1. Capture: register the hook into Claude Code (~/.claude/settings.json)
mimir install-hook          # idempotent; --print to paste the block yourself

# 2. Work normally. Failures get logged to ~/.mimir/episodes.jsonl.

# 3. Consolidate: distill logged failures into gated, signed lessons
mimir consolidate

# 4. Serve: gated recall over MCP (stdio), backed by the same store
mimir-serve
```

What you consolidate is what gets served — both sides run on the same
Cognee/LanceDB-backed lesson store under `~/.mimir/`.

**Also on Cline and Hermes:** `mimir install-hook --cline` writes the
`PostToolUse` hook script Cline picks up automatically (capture only).
Hermes gets two drop-in plugins: `hermes_plugin/` captures tool-call
failures the same way, and `hermes_memory_plugin/` goes further — it
registers Mimir as an actual Hermes `MemoryProvider`, so `mimir.recall`
serves lessons straight into Hermes' prompt (`memory.provider: mimir` in
Hermes' `config.yaml`). New integrations, schemas not yet verified against a
live session; [open an issue](https://github.com/kirnsal/mimir/issues) if
something doesn't map correctly.

## Built on Cognee

Semantic storage and retrieval run on [Cognee](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee)'s
LanceDB vector engine (`mimir/store_cognee.py`). Lessons are embedded and
recalled through Cognee; the persisted LESSON objects remain the source of
truth and the vector index is rebuilt from them on load.

Mimir implements the full memory lifecycle, with Cognee as the semantic engine
underneath:

| Lifecycle stage | Where it lives in Mimir |
|---|---|
| **remember** | `mimir install-hook` + `mimir.capture` — episodes logged from real agent sessions |
| **memify** (improve) | `mimir consolidate` / `mimir.consolidate` — failures distilled into judged, ε-gated, HMAC-signed lessons in the Cognee-backed store |
| **recall** | `mimir.recall`, served by `mimir-serve` — confidence-gated semantic retrieval over Cognee's LanceDB index |
| **forget** | `mimir.forget` — explicit, bi-temporal retirement; lessons are also auto-quarantined/superseded on contradicting evidence (never hard-deleted), and excluded from recall either way |

---

## MCP tools

`mimir-serve` exposes the full lifecycle over stdio — any MCP client (Claude
Code included) can drive it directly:

- `mimir.capture` (**remember**) — log an episode directly (when not using the hook)
- `mimir.consolidate` (**memify**) — distill logged failures into judged, ε-gated,
  HMAC-signed lessons in the Cognee-backed store
- `mimir.recall` (**recall**) — confidence-gated, Cognee-ranked lesson retrieval
  for the current context
- `mimir.forget` (**forget**) — retire a lesson for good; bi-temporal, so the
  prior version stays on record for audit but is excluded from recall

`mimir.attribute` (single-lesson counterfactual credit) stays CLI/bench-only —
it needs an injected solver callable, bound only inside the C5 benchmark harness.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirnsal/mimir && cd mimir
pip install -e '.[dev,mcp,cognee]'
pytest
```

Python ≥ 3.10. The core package is dependency-free; `mcp` and `cognee` are
optional extras imported lazily, so tests run without either installed.
