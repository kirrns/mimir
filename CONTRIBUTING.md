# Contributing to Mimir

Thanks for considering contributing — Mimir is early (v0.0.1) and every bit
of help matters.

## Ways to contribute

- Report bugs or suggest features via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kirnsal/mimir/issues)
- Improve documentation
- Contribute code or tests
- Review open pull requests

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirnsal/mimir && cd mimir
pip install -e '.[dev,mcp,embed]'
pytest
```

Branch from `main`. Keep pull requests focused — one change, one PR.

## Before opening a PR

- Add or update tests for any behavior change (the offline suite must stay
  token-free; live-model tests are opt-in, see `bench/live.py`)
- Run `pytest` locally — the full suite should pass
- Keep the diff scoped to the stated change; avoid unrelated refactors
