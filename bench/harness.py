"""C5 — WARM/COLD benchmark harness (skeleton).

The whole rubric headline is one curve: success-rate/score lift (WARM minus
COLD) across a task set. This skeleton proves the loop deterministically with a
COLD baseline; WARM is the same `run()` handed a `recall` callable (wired to the
C4 retrieval server later). The solver is pluggable so the harness stays
LLM-agnostic and the loop mechanics are testable without a live model.

Loop (BUILD_SPEC C5): run -> score (deterministic verifier) -> [later] failed
EPISODE captured (C1) -> consolidate (C2) -> next task recalls LESSONs (C4).
