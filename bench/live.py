"""Live integration — the real `claude` CLI as the solver (run it yourself).

`python -m bench.live` spends tokens; importing/testing this module does not.
Only the SOLVER is swapped for a real model — the harness, the C4 recall gate,
and the verifier are unchanged. The verifier is REAL: it execs the code Claude
returns against asserts, so a pass means the bug is actually fixed (not a
keyword match). Judge and probe stay the deterministic stand-ins from loop.py;
wire those for fully-live consolidation later.

ponytail: `_exec_score` runs model-generated code in a throwaway namespace on
your own machine, deliberately, like SWE-bench does. It is NOT a sandbox — run
real benchmark sets in a container if you don't trust the output.
