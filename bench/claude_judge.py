"""Live C2 judge + held-out probe — real Claude doing FR1 extraction and FR3 admission.

Swaps the deterministic stand-ins from bench/live.py for real model calls. Like
claude_cli.py, every call goes through run_claude's `_runner` seam, so the wiring
is verified with ZERO tokens; only `python -m bench.live` spends anything.

The judge is a single batched structured call (memory constraint: ~10x cheaper
than per-criterion calls). The probe runs the real solver on a held-out task set.
